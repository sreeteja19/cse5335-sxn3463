a) I used node.js server frame as it allows users to handle large number of aplications simulataneously with high through put. nodejs uses event loop to 
run the events according to their size rather than  fisrt come fisrt serve
b)I used jquery in client side frame work as it flexible to change the contents of page dynamically.Jquery enables users to change Ajax templates. 
where ajax on other hand performs its operation without reloading the full page.
c)backend of the project is easy because of node.js libraries which run on V8 engine. Theselibraries are built on asynchronous approach to provide a fast,
scalable system. 
d)there is difficulty at ajax calling
e)I did not use other components other than client and server framework.
f) Ubuntu commands that are required to deploy the code are
   a) git ass .
   b) git commit -m "xyz "
   c) git push heroku master
